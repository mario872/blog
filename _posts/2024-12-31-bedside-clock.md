# Bedside Clock
For a while now, I've been meaning to make a new clock for my bedside table. My current clock used to be a dalek projector clock, which would project the time on the roof of my bedroom. It worked for a while, but it started getting too easy to turn off the alarm, so I bodged together a 3D printed box to put the guts in. A side effect of this was that the alarm had to be turned off 5-10 times in a row before it would actually turn off, so I achieved my goal.
